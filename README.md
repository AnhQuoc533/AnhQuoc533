Hello, my name is Hoang Anh Quoc Le, but you can call me Quoc. I am an international student in the US, coming from Vietnam. My major is Computer Science, and I aim to specialize in Artificial Intelligence.

As a full-time student, it is my responsibility to highly dedicate myself to my studies with the desire to attain success in my field. In my family, I am the first generation to attend college. Therefore, I am studying not only for myself but also for my parents, who did not have the chance to get a higher education. Nothing is more worthwhile than making my parents happy and proud of me.

My lifetime goal is to land a dream job as a machine learning engineer and pursue a research career that will greatly contribute to the advancement of the field of A.I. in the near future.
