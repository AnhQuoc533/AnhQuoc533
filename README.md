# ðŸ‘‹ &nbsp;HI, I'M QUOC
I am a full-time student at Northern Virginia Community College. My major is Computer Science, and I aim to specialize in Artificial Intelligence.

I am proficient in Python programming and have had several projects made with Python. I also learned about numerous fundamental machine-learning algorithms, and began to study Python at an advanced level.

My lifetime goal is to land a dream job as a machine learning engineer and pursue a research career that will greatly contribute to the advancement of AI in the near future.
